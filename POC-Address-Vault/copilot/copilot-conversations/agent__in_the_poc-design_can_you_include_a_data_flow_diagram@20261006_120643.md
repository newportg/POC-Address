**user**: in the poc-design can you include a data flow diagram
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:06:43]

**ai**: Added a Mermaid data flow diagram to the Data Flow section of [[poc-design]], expanding the one-line summary into a step-by-step flow: search → Find API → markers → select → cache check → Verify API → cache store → formatted address.

Let me know if you'd like it changed to a sequence diagram style (matching API call ordering) or committed to git.

**user**: i was hoping for a data flow diagram like the one in the poc-address-design file
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:08:04]

**ai**: Replaced the flowchart-style diagram in [[poc-design]] with the same `sequenceDiagram` style used in [[poc-address-design]] — User / Svelte SPA / API Routes / LOQATE / SQLite Cache participants, including the cache hit/miss alt block.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:08:04]

**user**: can you include the component design and the userflow from the poc-address-design file
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:11:12]

**ai**: Added both to [[poc-design]]:

- **Component Diagram** — the `graph LR` pages/components/lib/API diagram, placed before the Data Flow section.
- **User Flow** — replaced the one-line summary with the `flowchart TD` from [[poc-address-design]].

**user**: can you remove the poc-address-design file and any references to it
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:12:20]

**ai**: Removed `wiki/poc-address-design.md` and cleaned its references in the wiki:

- `wiki/poc-design.md` — dropped the "overlaps with" note and the Related link
- `wiki/loqate-api.md` — dropped the Related link

Two leftover mentions I did **not** touch:
- `copilot/copilot-conversations/*.md` — historical chat logs; editing them would rewrite history
- `.obsidian/workspace.json` — still lists the file as an open tab; Obsidian will drop it next time you close/reopen that tab (or I can scrub it if you prefer)

Also note: anything unique that was only in `poc-address-design.md` (e.g. the LOQATE Integration section, ER diagram, endpoint parameters) is now gone from the wiki — only the diagrams you copied into `poc-design.md` survive. Let me know if you want any of that preserved.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:12:20]

**user**: is the poc-address file needed, or is all the content covered in the other md files
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:14:53]

**ai**: Mostly yes — but not entirely. Comparing `wiki/poc-address.md` against the other two files:

**Covered elsewhere:**
- Architecture summary → covered by diagrams + stack table in [[poc-design]]
- Endpoint list → [[poc-design]] table
- Find recursive drill-down → [[loqate-api]] (and the detailed version was in the now-deleted `poc-address-design.md`)
- Verify API purpose → [[loqate-api]]
- Response fields → [[loqate-api]]

**Unique to `poc-address.md`:**
- The **UPU S42** note (line 53–55) — not recorded anywhere else
- The **archive/Readme.md** reference links (lines 57–60)
- The concrete Find example (`tf26rf` → Postcode container → addresses)

If you want to delete it, I'd first move those two bits into [[loqate-api]] or [[poc-design]]. Also heads-up: the full Verify API request/response field details (request body JSON, AddressFormat field list) lived only in the deleted `poc-address-design.md` — `loqate-api.md` covers the fields in a table but not the request body shape. Say the word if you want me to consolidate any of this before removing the file.

(Side note: I also fixed a stray self-link I'd introduced in `loqate-api.md`'s Related line.)
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:14:53]

**user**: please consolidate
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:16:53]

**ai**: Consolidated and removed `wiki/poc-address.md`:

- **UPU S42 standard note** → moved to [[poc-design]] (new "Standard" section)
- **archive/Readme.md references** → moved to [[poc-design]] (new "Reference" section)
- **Verify API request body + full field list** → moved to [[loqate-api]] (new "Verify API Request" section, restoring detail lost when `poc-address-design.md` was removed)
- Removed the `[[poc-address]]` Related links from [[poc-design]] and [[loqate-api]]

`[[poc-design]]` and `[[loqate-api]]` now cover everything. The Find recursive example (`tf26rf` → postcode container → addresses) was already in `loqate-api.md`, so no loss there. Same caveat as before: `.obsidian/workspace.json` may still list it as an open tab.

**user**: can you clean up the loqate-api file, Verify API Request is repeated
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:20:18]

**ai**: Merged the two "Verify API Request" sections in [[loqate-api]] into one: the curl example, the v1.20 endpoint note, the request body JSON, and the key response fields now live under a single heading. The duplicate section and heading are gone.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:20:18]

**user**: can you update the links
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:42:22]

**ai**: Updated the broken/mismatched wiki links:

- `[[addressing-standards-overview]]` → `[[Overview]]` (in UPU-S42.md, ISO-20022.md)
- `[[iso-20022]]` → `[[ISO-20022]]` (in UPU-S42.md, Overview.md)

All `[[...]]` links in the wiki now resolve to actual files: `Overview`, `UPU-S42`, `ISO-20022`, `UK-Address-Format`, `Loqate-api`, `Poc-Design`. No links remain to the deleted `poc-address` or `poc-address-design` notes.

**user**: can you recreate the international-addressing.html file from the wiki pages. keeping the existing css and tab layout
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:45:13]

**ai**: Recreated `outputs/international-addressing.html` from the wiki pages. What changed:

- **Same CSS, tab layout, and tab-switch script** — only the content and a small `.mermaid` style block were added.
- **POC Design tab** — the hand-written SVG architecture diagram and the flow-div diagrams were replaced with the actual Mermaid diagrams from [[Poc-Design]] (architecture flowchart, new Component Diagram, Data Flow sequenceDiagram, User Flow flowchart), rendered via the Mermaid CDN with `theme: 'dark'`. Also added the **Standard** section (UPU S42 note).
- **LOQATE API tab** — now includes the consolidated Verify API content from [[Loqate-api]]: curl example, v1.20 endpoint, request body JSON, and key response fields.
- **Overview / UPU S42 / ISO 20022 / UK Format tabs** — content aligned with the wiki pages (they were already largely in sync).

One caveat: the page now loads Mermaid from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js`, so the diagrams require an internet connection. If you need it fully offline, I can inline a Mermaid build or convert the diagrams back to static SVG.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:45:13]

**user**: the poc-design tab is missing the architecture and component diagrams. can all the diagrams be rendered in svg.

The Loqate API page does not represent the current wiki page
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:54:26]

**ai**: Both fixed:

**Diagrams now inline SVG** — I rendered the four Mermaid diagrams from [[Poc-Design]] with `mermaid-cli` (dark theme, transparent background) and embedded the SVGs directly in the HTML. No CDN script needed, so all four (architecture, component, data flow sequence, user flow) render offline. Each SVG's internal IDs were made unique to avoid conflicts. The Mermaid `<script>` tags are removed.

**LOQATE API tab rebuilt from the current wiki page** — it now mirrors `wiki/Loqate-api.md` exactly: Find API with Request/Response/Subsequent Request/Response JSON, Recursive Find Flow, then Verify API Request (Detail API) with the v1.20 endpoint, the curl block, and the full Liverpool Street response JSON. The old duplicated "Verify API Request" and "Key response fields" content is gone.

Intermediate `.mmd`/`.svg` files are in `outputs/mmd/` if you want to regenerate later; delete that folder if you don't need it.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 12:54:26]

**user**: can the diagrams be rendered like the original international-addressing.html style
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 13:00:18]

**ai**: Restored the original rendering style in the POC Design tab:

- **Architecture** — back to the original hand-coded inline SVG (gradient group boxes, rounded rectangles, arrows) from the pre-Mermaid version.
- **Data Flow & User Flow** — back to the original `.flow` step-and-arrow chip rows instead of Mermaid diagrams.
- **Component Diagram** — new section, drawn as inline SVG in the same visual language as the architecture diagram (Pages / Components / Lib / API columns with arrows).
- **Standard** — kept the UPU S42 section from the wiki, placed before Technology Stack.
- All Mermaid markup and the CDN script are removed, so the page is fully self-contained again.

The LOQATE API tab still reflects the current wiki page. The generated `.mmd`/`.svg` artifacts remain in `outputs/mmd/` — safe to delete if you no longer need them.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 13:00:18]

**user**: can you create a publish script that will recreate the html file
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 13:03:45]

**ai**: Done. The publish pipeline is set up:

**New files:**
- `outputs/publish.ps1` — the publish script. Run it with `powershell -File outputs/publish.ps1` from the workspace root; it writes `outputs/international-addressing.html`.
- `outputs/template.html` — the full HTML skeleton (CSS, tab strip, tab-switch script) with `{{OVERVIEW}}`, `{{UPU}}`, `{{ISO}}`, `{{UK}}`, `{{API}}`, `{{DESIGN}}` placeholders.
- `outputs/design-tab.html` — the POC Design tab markup, inserted verbatim because its hand-drawn SVG diagrams can't be derived from the wiki's Mermaid blocks.
- `outputs/international-addressing.bak.html` — backup of the previous page (pre-script regeneration).

**How it works:** for Overview / UPU S42 / ISO 20022 / UK Format / LOQATE API it reads the wiki pages (`wiki/Overview.md`, `UPU-S42.md`, `ISO-20022.md`, `UK-Address-Format.md`, `Loqate-api.md`), converts headings, tables, code fences, bullet/numbered lists and paragraphs to HTML, wraps each in the tab/card chrome, then merges everything with the template.

**Caveats:**
- The tab bodies are now *faithful conversions of the wiki markdown*, so they read a bit plainer than the hand-crafted HTML (e.g. the UK address-lines visualization is now a table, the Overview two-column comparison is now a section + table). The POC Design tab keeps the original styled markup exactly.
- Icons/emoji were replaced with `ConvertFromUtf32` char codes in the script because PS 5.1 misreads emoji in un-BOM'd UTF-8 files — the emitted HTML contains the real emoji.
- A `.mermaid` CSS rule remains in the template's `<style>` block; harmless leftover.

**user**: the publish scripts and any related files should be within the vault\scripts directory
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 13:11:59]

**ai**: Moved and verified. `scripts/publish.ps1` now lives in `POC-Address-Vault/scripts/` along with `template.html` and `design-tab.html`, its paths were updated (wiki → `<vault>/wiki`, fragment/template → `scripts/`, output → `outputs/`), and re-running it from the vault root regenerated `outputs/international-addressing.html` successfully.

`outputs/international-addressing.bak.html` (the backup of the pre-script version) is still in `outputs/` — move it into `scripts/` too if you want everything publish-related in one place.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 13:11:59]

**user**: in the poc directory is the static poc app. currently the map tiles only correctly work when run from a webserver. this needs to be run from a github page so has to be a static web app
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 13:15:25]

**ai**: Done. Changes:

**`POC/poc-address-app.html` (and the copy now in `docs/index.html`):**
- Tile layer switched from `https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/...` to the canonical `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`, with `crossOrigin: true`.
- Fixed Leaflet's default marker icons with absolute unpkg URLs — they use relative paths that 404 when the page is served from a subpath, which is exactly what happens on GitHub Pages.

**New `docs/` folder at the repo root** (repo root is `C:\Source\Obsidian\Projects\POC-Address`) with `index.html` (copy of the app) and an empty `.nojekyll`, so GitHub can serve it without Jekyll processing.

**Why tiles failed before:** OSM's tile CDN rejects browser requests with no `Referer` header — which is what happens when you open the file via `file://`. A webserver (localhost or GitHub Pages) sends a referer, so tiles load. On GitHub Pages this will work as-is; locally, test with a simple static server rather than double-clicking the file, e.g. `npx serve docs` from the repo root.

**To publish:** push the repo, then in GitHub → Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`. Site will be at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`. Note the demo mode works without an API key; live LOQATE calls need a key entered in the Configuration tab (stored in localStorage).

Also note there's an older static copy at `outputs/poc-address-app.html` — it's now out of sync; delete it or tell me and I'll sync/remove it.
[Timestamp: 2026/10/06 13:15:25]

**user**: ok I want the static web app to appear as  a tab on the international-addressing.html. can you update the script, and create a github action to publish it to the github pages
